import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwindcss()],
});
// After reviewing the code, there isnâ€™t an error with the Vite configuration itself:
// - It correctly imports "defineConfig" from "vite".
// - It imports the Tailwind CSS plugin from "@tailwindcss/vite" and uses it in the plugins array.
//
// However, one potential enhancement might be worth noting: if your project uses React
// (as suggested by your JSX files), you could consider adding the "@vitejs/plugin-react" plugin
// to enable better JSX support and Fast Refresh.
//
// In summary, there is no inherent problem with this code as written.
